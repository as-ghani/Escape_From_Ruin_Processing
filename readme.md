“Escape from Ruins” is an arcade runner type of game. The player has to escape the ruins that
are filled with traps. However, our greedy character will not just escape the ruins. The character
will try to collect as many coins that are randomly scattered on the ground while escaping the
ruins within a certain time. If the player does not collect coins, they will not get any extra scores.
However, if the player focuses on collecting the coins and does not escape, the time will run out
and the player will die. To win the player needs to grab the key and reach the gate.

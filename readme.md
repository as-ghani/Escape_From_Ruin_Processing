# Escape from Ruins
## Processing Game Engine Project:

“Escape from Ruins” is an arcade runner type of game. The player has to escape the ruins that
are filled with traps. However, our greedy character will not just escape the ruins. The character
will try to collect as many coins that are randomly scattered on the ground while escaping the
ruins within a certain time. If the player does not collect coins, they will not get any extra scores.
However, if the player focuses on collecting the coins and does not escape, the time will run out
and the player will die. To win the player needs to grab the key and reach the gate.
There are two versions of the game available, one with sound and one without sound. In order to
play with the sound you need to import the official processing library.

## Controls:
### Player Movement:

The player movements are simply done by pressing the “w, a, s, d” keys. The “w” and “s” keys
will allow the player to move in the z-axis, which is equivalent to side to side. The “a” and “d”
keys will move the player to the x-axis, which is equivalent to back-and-forth movement.
